# Preparation of Calcium Acetate

- **Procedure**
  1. Place 50g calcium carbonate in a beaker with stir bar, add 1 mol acetic acid. 
 	 - The calcium carbonate can be reagent grade, or from eggshells/chalk. You will have to filter out the other solids before evaporating if using eggshells/chalk
 	 - The acetic acid can be glacial (~57mL) or from vinegar (~1.2L for 5% by mass vinegar)
  2. Continue stirring until carbon dioxide bubbles stop forming. This means the reaction is complete as calcium carbonate is in a slight excess
  3. Heat the solution to ~80–90 °C to evaporate the water off
  4. Remove from heat before nearly done and transfer to a watch glass to finish drying
  5. Measure 15 mL of dried calcium acetate, dissolve in 50 mL water. This is a supersaturated solution, so some undissolved calcium carbonate should be present 
  6. Slowly add the calcium acetate solution to 150 mL ethanol while stirring slowly with a glass stir rod. The calcium acetate should crash out of solution
